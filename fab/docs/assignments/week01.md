# 1. Principles and practices

This week I worked on defining my final project idea and started to getting used to the documentation process.

# AirText

"Basically its a painting with group of Neo Pixel stripe. It's is work with virtual visual/vision, it will be capture with eye of camera !"

- Normal Picture to Pixelize image
- Era of Digital but work with Analog way


> "I started work on it to make this analog way, for that, I use Neo pixel, controller, network board and started to make something unique which is some intresting and entertainment things."


## Project Initial Sketch

## Project Planning

In my final project, I used a two circuit box with two different supply.
![](../images/week 01/01.jpg)
Circuit Box 1 : Power supply ====>  Controller ====> Network Board ====> Neo Pixel
![](../images/week 01/02.jpg)
Circuit Box 2: Power supply ====>  Controller ====> Moter controll (It help to move pulley with feature of hooked to hang Neo pixel Strip)
![](../images/week 01/03.jpg)
It shows the motor which is connected with the belt who will control the pulley.

It Shows the pulley which hooked a Neo Pixel Strip that is moving through that.

Its a 3D type of view/Isolated sketch of AirText.

## Mobile Interface

For at all try to send image from mobile/Text directly to AirText

Function of each button of application

## Challenges

- compact Controller circuit.
- Controlling speed of motor.
- Upto now I'm done with text but now try with an image.
- Interconnection AirText with mobile interface.
- Try to make application for long shutter click (Now in Android).

## What to fabricate,What to buy!
